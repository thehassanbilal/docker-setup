# Dockerizing a NestJS Application

This guide will help you Dockerize your NestJS application, making it easier to set up and manage in different environments.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Basic knowledge of Docker.
- A working NestJS application.
- Docker installed on your system. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` tells Docker how to build your application image.

1. In the root directory of your NestJS project, create a file named `Dockerfile`.

2. Copy and paste the following code into your `Dockerfile`.

### Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Step 1: Use the official Node.js runtime as a base image
FROM node:20.16.0

# Step 2: Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy package.json and package-lock.json files to the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Step 4: Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Step 5: Copy the rest of the application code to the container
COPY . .

# Step 6: Build the NestJS application
RUN npm run build

# Step 7: Expose the port on which the app will run
EXPOSE 3000

# Step 8: Run the NestJS application
CMD ["npm", "run", "start:prod"]
```

## Step 2: Create a `.dockerignore` File

The `.dockerignore` file specifies which files and directories should be excluded from the Docker image to keep it lightweight.

1. In the root directory of your project, create a file named `.dockerignore`.

2. Copy and paste the following code into your `.dockerignore` file.

### .dockerignore

```plaintext
# Node modules
node_modules

# Build files
dist

# Docker files
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
.dockerignore

# Git files
.git
.gitignore
```

## Step 3: Build the Docker Image

Now, let's build the Docker image for your NestJS application.

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project's root directory.

2. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t your-app-name .
    ```

    Replace `your-app-name` with a suitable name for your Docker image.

## Step 4: Run the Docker Container

After building the image, you can run it in a container using:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 your-app-name
```

The `-p 3000:3000` flag maps port 3000 of the container to port 3000 on your local machine.

## Step 5: Optional - Use Docker Compose

If your application depends on multiple services (e.g., a database), Docker Compose can help manage them.

1. In the root of your project, create a file named `docker-compose.yml`.

2. Copy and paste the following configuration into your `docker-compose.yml` file.

### docker-compose.yml

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: your-app-name
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/your-database-name
      - PORT=3000
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    networks:
      - your-network-name
  mongo:
    image: mongo:latest
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
    networks:
      - your-network-name
volumes:
  mongo-data:
networks:
  your-network-name:
    driver: bridge
```

This setup includes a MongoDB service that the NestJS app depends on.

## Step 6: Run the Application with Docker Compose

To start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

## Step 7: Access Your Application

Once the containers are running, your NestJS application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Step 8: Stop the Containers

To stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes defined in the `docker-compose.yml`, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Step 9: Debugging and Logs

To view the logs of a running container, use:

```bash
docker logs <container_id_or_name>
```

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can easily Dockerize your NestJS application, streamlining deployment and scaling across various environments. Docker ensures your application behaves consistently, no matter where it is deployed.

This version makes each file's code separately copyable, making the process easier to follow.
