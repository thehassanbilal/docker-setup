# Dockerizing a NestJS Application

Dockerizing your NestJS application can significantly simplify the process of setting up development, testing, and production environments. This guide will walk you through the steps to containerize your NestJS app using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of Docker.
- A working NestJS application.
- Docker installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [Docker's official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

A `Dockerfile` is a script that contains a series of instructions to build a Docker image. To start:

1. In the root of your NestJS project, create a file named `Dockerfile`.

2. Add the following content to the `Dockerfile`:

    ```Dockerfile
    #Step 1: Use an oficial Node.js runtime as a base image
    FROM node:20.16.0 
    
    #Step 2: Set the working directory inside the container
    WORKDIR /app
    
    #Step 3: Copy package.json and package-lock.json files to container
    COPY package*.json ./
    
    #Step 4: Install dependencies
    RUN npm install
    
    #Step 5: Copy the rest of the application code to the container
    COPY . .
    
    #Step 6: Build the NestJS application
    RUN npm run build
    
    #Step 7: Expose the port on which the app will run
    EXPOSE 3000
    
    #Step 8: Run the NestJS application
    CMD ["npm", "run", "start:prod"]
    ```

## Step 2: Create a `.dockerignore` File

To prevent unnecessary files from being included in the Docker image, create a `.dockerignore` file in the root of your project:

```plaintext
# node modules
node_modules

# build files
dist

# docker files
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
.dockerignore

# git files
.git
.gitignore
```

This ensures that the Docker image remains lightweight.

## Step 3: Build the Docker Image

Navigate to your projectâ€™s root directory in the terminal and run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t your-app-name .
```

Replace `your-app-name` with an appropriate name for your Docker image.

## Step 4: Run the Docker Container

After building the image, you can run it in a container using the command:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 your-app-name
```

The `-p 3000:3000` flag maps port 3000 of the container to port 3000 on your local machine.

## Step 5: Optional - Use Docker Compose

If your application relies on multiple services (e.g., a database), you can manage them using Docker Compose.

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of your project.

2. Add the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'
    services:
      app:
        image: your-app-name
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
        ports:
          - "3000:3000"
        environment:
          NODE_ENV: production
        depends_on:
          - mongo
        command: npm run start:prod

      mongo:
        image: mongo:latest
        ports:
          - "27017:27017"
        volumes:
          - mongo-data:/data/db

    volumes:
      mongo-data:
    ```

This setup includes a MongoDB service that the NestJS app depends on.

## Step 6: Run the Application with Docker Compose

To start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

## Step 7: Access Your Application

Once the containers are up and running, your NestJS application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Step 8: Stop the Containers

To stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes defined in the `docker-compose.yml`, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Step 9: Debugging and Logs

To view the logs of a running container, use:

```bash
docker logs <container_id_or_name>
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily Dockerize your NestJS application, making it easier to manage, deploy, and scale across different environments. Docker provides a consistent environment for development, testing, and production, ensuring your application behaves the same regardless of where it's deployed.
